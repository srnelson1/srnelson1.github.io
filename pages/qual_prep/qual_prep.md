<h2 class="title">
	Qual Prep
</h2>



I am collecting solutions to different UGA quals on this website. You can find past UGA quals in most of the subjects {%include link.html href="https://www.math.uga.edu/past-qualifying-exams-0" text="here"%}. Also, please inform me about any mistakes, typos, or errors. I cannot guarantee that each write up is correct, so do not take my notes as authoritative.

If I did not know how to solve a problem, it is stated in red. If a solution is simply not given, I have just not gotten to it yet. (You can always send me a texed solution :D ). There are some problems that I regard as "classic." For these problems, I have written (Classic) on the problem in red. Some problems are not classic, but have classic techniques, and in these cases I have written (Classic Technique).

## <span style="color: #007fff;"> Analysis </span>


Note: for some of these problems, the theorem concerning differentiation under the integral sign, also known as the Feynman technique or the Leibniz integral rule, is improperly applied.

## <span style="color:  #007fff;"> Topology </span>

I have not written up anything on topology, but you can find some qual solutions at Delaney's website {% include link.html href="https://sites.google.com/view/delaney-morgan/qualifying-exam-materials" text="here" %}.

## <span style="color:  #007fff;"> Further Resources </span>

This is a collection of qual resources that may be useful.

- {% include link.html href="https://www.math.uga.edu/past-qualifying-exams-0" text="Historical qual problems." %}

- Zack Garza's {% include link.html href="https://quals.dzackgarza.com/" text="website" %}: this is a great resources providing study materials of the different quals, and some solutions for different qual problems as well. He also has notes covering specific subject areas.

- Delaney Morgan's {% include link.html href="https://sites.google.com/view/delaney-morgan/qualifying-exam-materials" text="website" %}: as mentioned, this is a good resource for the topology qual.
