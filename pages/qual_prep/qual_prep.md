<h2 class="title">
	Qual Prep
</h2>



I am collecting solutions to different UGA quals on this website. You can find past UGA quals in most of the subjects {%include link.html href="https://www.math.uga.edu/past-qualifying-exams-0" text="here"%}. They go back quite a long way. Please use these notes judicuously, and spend time on each problem before checking a solution. Also, please inform me about any mistakes, typos, or errors. I cannot guarantee that each write up is correct, so do not take my notes as authoritative.

There are some problems that I have not solved, and when this is the case I have noted it under the problem in red. If a solution is not given, I have just been too lazy and slow to write it. In either case, you can always provide me a solution. I will make sure to credit you for it on the website.

Finally, there are some problems that I regard as "classic." For these problems, I have written (Classic) on the problem in red. Some problems are not classic, but have classic techniques, and in these cases I have also written (Classic). I plan to change these problems to (Classic Technique) to spare you the trouble of figuring out if its a classic problem or classic technique. Also, I still have not gotten around to labeling all the classic problems.
